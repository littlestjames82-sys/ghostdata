"""Sensitive column detection: by name and by value shape.

A column is redacted when its name matches a sensitive pattern, or when
enough of its values match a sensitive shape (email, phone, payment
card with a Luhn check, SSN). Shape checks run on string values, and
on native JSON integers for the card shape only. Detection stores
counters only, never the values themselves.
